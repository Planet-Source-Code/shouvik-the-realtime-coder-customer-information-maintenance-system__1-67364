## Customer Information Maintenance System


</div>

### Description

I've developed this system for a website developing company. It takes input from the user,validates those and then stores it into the database. It uses DAO connection. It also has modification, searching, renew membership, printing of bills, emailing bills, details view of all records with status and lots of things. The code is not too much complicated. This is my first submission on PSC. Please comment on this code and send feedback. At any time please fill free to write to me @ choudhuryshouvik@yahoo.com
